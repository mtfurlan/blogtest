title: Temperature controlled peltier box
---

This was for a drug that says it should be "room temperature", or 20-25C, but
the rooms in my house are more like 15-30C, and I sometimes go outside for a
few weeks.

So, peltier box that can heat and cool as required.

Turns out my doctor says it's fine to keep at 15-30 so this project stopped
after making the controller before testing it insid a box


Parts:
* amazon special STC-1000 thermostat with heat/cool relay outputs
* constant current driver
* peltier pads
* h bridge relay I found
* a pair of diodes, the paper said 1N4002

Looks like I can fit all the stuff inside the STC-1000 enclosure, lots of space

The not populated stuff is almost certainly because one of the versions
supports 240VAC not 12VDC, but I have a fair bit less components than the three
[Big Clive has](https://youtu.be/T4umSkJjXwY?si=-hwj4bqc9eLnjrpS)...

Seems to work though, so I made everything fit

It did require sanding down the constant current/constant voltage driver a mm or
so

I reused the heat/cool relay screw terminals for my fan output by just cutting
the relay traces and drilling more holes in the board to fit my wires

Next steps: make a box and see how badly it keeps temperature

Would maybe be nice to have a button to enable the display, for future battery
reasons, but if I actually want to care about low power the extra relays and
STC-1000 is the wrong approach anyway
