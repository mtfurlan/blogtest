## eleventy notes
* tagging pages as "scaffolding" if they need to be in collections.all but aren't real content

## Questions/ideas
### Navbar layout
* Include current page in breadcrumbs?
  * If not, just have nothing on landing page?
  * If not, also add back in trailing >>

### landing page
* node visualization
* blog posts down the side, each linked to prev and next

## Bugs
Yay

## TODOs
* [[links?]]
* blog/index, add short descriptions?
* wiki/notes pages
  * backlinks: https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden
* fingerprinting css? https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/09/cache-busting-eleventy-simpler-way-sass/
* finalize page layout a little more
* sort lyrics by title
* image alt text mouseover
* semantic layout passthrough
* getGitLastUpdatedTimeStamp: handle unstaged changes
