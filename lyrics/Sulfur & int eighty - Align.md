Yo, shout out to my lockpickers, physical pentesters, all that
check it
set three, set four, set five, hut
never knock already copied how your key cut
restricted floor, in the door, like what what
ain't a safe that I couldn't crack like a chestnut
strut in the spot and I'm feeling great
catch a signal for the front gate
now I emulate
and I infiltrate areas with master access
so assured on levels of death and taxes

this is for mine watching LPL
who see master lock number threes and LOLs
who peep in the front door on the crib they dwell
spot an unattended padlock and feel compelled

crew full of the most ambitious
graduated from covert to surreptitious
never even had a chance to grow suspicious
wanna catch me and mine grab a genie and wish it


knowledge is power
challenge apathy resisting ignorance
what's closed shall be open to those who just envision it
liftin' pins a simple click
the mind set that shifted with
tension steady climbing while guiding this with a dimple fit
status quo was evergreen
if you know the recipe
temporary mechanisms broken for a century
so I hold the pedigrees
rolling to the mezzanine
peep the covert entry like we whisper "open sesame"
hold the memories
distill important lessons
the past shapes the future
experience forms impressions
times path into mind math thwarting connections
expand understand and develop and further question
crack to win
comprehend the secrets are slim
on the floor
under door
pull the handle I'm in
tumblers spin
intercept the stops with a shim
break the shackle free of hassle
on this journey within

Sometimes it's timing
sometimes it's vibing
A little bit of art with a little bit of science
Sometimes it's crime when we test your appliance
Pins in the lock like the stars in alignment

Sometimes it's timing
sometimes it's vibing
A little bit of art mixed with little bit of science
A little bit of art mixed with a bit of science
It's almost always crime when we test your appliance
Pins in the lock like the stars in alignment
