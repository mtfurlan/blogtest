It's the fire that environment vital void
the fight in the mineral modern day
final frontier of the fathering
dull and mundane, molten skull, melt the bulk of the brain
we're like minded, and not minding the pain

yeah that fire, burning bridges
turning citizens into furnace victims
it's what I'm learning inside this world we live in
charcoal fiends
breathing carbon like we're starving for disease
but I bet it's in the water
And we'll be quarantined to the seven seas
cause this virus doesn't reside in the earth, doesn't hide in the breeze
it's why we poison the streams
and why we ride in the streets
that's why the roots of doomsday is alive in these trees
News today, just silent screams
like fifty of in who saying died for your wildest dreams
before the melting pot playing with fire and water
and we're boiling over then why even bother
for those

[[Chorus x2]]
Pipe Dreams
Wish the guns that cause flows and ice fat the fame
are you attached to chains
just roll the dice
yeah that's the game
but those are pipe dreams

So it's come down to this right
this tight right fist right fist fight
bust my lip right
I heard that shit, I said what the kids like
it's midnight
you left the seeds with the TV to teach em
and all the eden that the preachers can feed em
but what's that cooking now
I smell a cook around
I see a rat that took a crown
I see a shook town
but you don't look around
you keep driving straight
It's a long ride for a mind to waste
find a designer define character
you're a Melrose slave
get your cell phone paid
dig your self own grave
so trap so played
sick days switch blades close range
and they got em, god they got em lined up
so wise up rise up
from the bottom to the top of the bottom
we gottem
product by product

[[Chorus x2]]

Take the weight on
break your backbone
bring it back home
diggin that duggery uh uh
look at that flow
tic a tac toe?
[???]
but I sick of that though, on to me?
keep it equal
[???] people
fuck your ego
[???]
but another MC better breathe and
be the better man

you better be better
go get it, go get a flow
meta, more [TODO]

said it more straight forward
ages sixteenths, eights, and fours and [TODO]

And we been tipping on four scores
and seven till it's scraped
donny six slick living slippin
skip grinning till they click the clank keyboard

it seemed to be the way we liked to keep it sleepin in the pussy getting shot for freezin
and that is not the reason
and that is not even all, we're feeding this demon with song, hit the pause
We teaching the seeds to clog, hit the gauze
we bleeding in raw
teething on a rock with a broken jaw
not sleeping, knock mahogany
poppa shot at me for not speaking hot monotony
but that ain't me, shit ain't free
and it seems they happen to be some gluttons for greed and pipe dreams

[[Chorus x2]]
