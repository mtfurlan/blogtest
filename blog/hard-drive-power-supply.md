Really more of a test post to get this blog off the ground, but today I made a power supply for a hard drive out of some 12v power brick by soldering in a LM78M05 to add a 5v rail.



The package on the right side closest to the camera is the LM78M05.

At this point, I ran it for a bit , and it seemed to get hot, and I noticed that the LM78M05 had a bit of a bad connection to the heatsink. So I added a bunch of thermal paste.

Closed up up, and it seems to work fine.

Totally not a pile of hack.
